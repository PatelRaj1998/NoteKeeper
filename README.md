# NoteKeeper

NoteKeeper is a JAVA notes app using JFrame Forms. This app is intended to automatically
backup users notes onto their Google Drive. Since the notes are automatically backed up to
user’s Google Drive account, users can access their notes from any computer as long as they
have the application installed. Additionally, the app will feature note encryption. The encrypted
notes are password protected and the user must enter a password to access and decrypt the
notes.
